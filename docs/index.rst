dask-hpcconfig: database of cluster configurations
==================================================

`dask`_, `distributed`_ and `deployment packages`_ like
`dask-jobqueue`_ or `dask-kubernetes`_ have a dazzling amount of
settings allowing to fine-tune a cluster.

However, as useful as that is for experts, new users easily get
confused by the steps necessary to create a cluster. For `dask-jobqueue`_:

1. copy this configuration file to that directory and remember the
   name
2. install the appropriate deployment package
3. instantiate the appropriate class using that name,
   e.g. :py:class:`dask_jobqueue.PBSCluster`

``dask-hpcconfig`` aims to make this much easier by providing a
unified API and by shipping a pre-configured set of cluster
definitions. This will change the list above to:

1. install the appropriate deployment package
2. call :py:func:`dask_hpcconfig.cluster` with the desired cluster
   configuration name

where :py:func:`dask_hpcconfig.cluster` will tell the name of the
package to install if it is still missing.
